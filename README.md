This is an example of a complete HTML/JavaScript page that implements a “Kahoot‐style” quiz with 12 questions.
In this example each question plays an MP3 file and asks the user to choose whether the clip is “AI generated” or “Human created.”
When an answer is chosen the corresponding button turns red or green.
At the end a summary is displayed and the results are sent via a POST to a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORWzX6VZrORWNU75aucBeX9J1Ft4EbvC9GmmxYokuXM/edit?usp=sharing).
